🌍 International Tourism Dashboard

Hi 👋, this is one of my beginner data analytics projects.
I wanted to take some raw travel expense data, clean it, and then turn it into something visual and easy to understand.

🛠 What I used

Python (Pandas, NumPy) → for cleaning and preparing the dataset

Power BI → for building the interactive dashboard

Excel → for quick checks and simple summaries

📊 What the dashboard shows

Total expenses (both INR & USD)

Split between Accommodation and Transportation costs

Country-wise rankings for travel expenses

Gender distribution of travellers (Male/Female)

City-wise expense comparison (Accommodation vs Transport)

Filters to check by Year and Travel Type

✨ Key Insights

Total travel expenses = ₹6.09M (~73.26K USD)

Transportation takes the biggest share (68%) compared to accommodation (32%)

Top spending countries were Brazil, Spain, and Emirates

Female travellers slightly higher than male (54% vs 46%)
